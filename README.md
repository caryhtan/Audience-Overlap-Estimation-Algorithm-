Project Title: Audience Overlap Estimation Algorithm

Project Description:
Developed an algorithm to estimate audience overlap across multiple demographic characteristics. The project involved data preprocessing, merging datasets, calculating lower bounds, and refining estimates using a joint distribution approach.

Responsibilities and Achievements:
- Loaded and merged demographic and visitor data using Python and pandas.
- Implemented a lower bound calculation function for conservative audience size estimates.
- Designed and executed an overlap estimation algorithm for various demographic characteristics.
- Utilized data visualization tools to present insights derived from the algorithm's results.
- Successfully handled data exceptions to ensure robustness in real-world scenarios.

Technologies and Tools:
- Programming Languages: Python

Results:
- Developed a refined lower bound estimation for audience overlap, contributing to improved insights for marketing strategies and target audience analysis.

Learnings:
- Enhanced proficiency in data manipulation and analysis using pandas and numpy.
- Gained experience in handling diverse data formats and ensuring data quality.
- Developed skills in algorithm design for practical business applications.
